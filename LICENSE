## Additional Terms for Todo Paranoid VS Code Extension

### Purpose and Scope

This extension is designed to help developers prevent accidental commits of sensitive or temporary comments. The protection mechanisms (Git API integration and Git hooks) are implemented locally on the user's machine and do not transmit any data externally.

### Data Collection and Privacy

- **No data collection**: This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data or code content.
- **Local operation**: All functionality operates entirely within the user's local development environment.
- **No telemetry**: No usage statistics or analytics are collected.

### Git Hook Disclaimer

The extension may create Git hooks in your repositories (.git/hooks/pre-commit). These hooks:

- Are created locally on your machine only
- Do not affect other collaborators unless they also install the extension
- Persist after extension uninstallation (by design, for security)
- Can be manually removed at any time by the user

### Liability Limitation

While this extension is designed to prevent accidental commits of sensitive comments, users are responsible for:

- Reviewing their own code before committing
- Ensuring sensitive information is properly handled
- Understanding that no tool is 100% foolproof

- Microsoft Visual Studio Code
